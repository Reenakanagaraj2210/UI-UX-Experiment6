# UI-UX-Experiment6
To disign ideation, user stories, scenarios, flow diagrams, and information architecture, with tools like Figma for visualization and design.

## Aim:
To design and prototype a user-friendly solution for booking appointments in a hospital app using UX methodologies such 
as ideation, user stories, scenarios, flow diagrams, and information architecture, with tools like Figma for visualization and design.
## Algorithm:
Step 1: Problem Definition
        Identify a known UX problem: e.g., “Booking a doctor’s appointment is confusing for some users.”

Step 2: Solution Ideation (Crazy 8s / Brainwriting)
        Open Figma or FigJam
        Create a frame divided into 8 boxes (2x4 grid)
        Set a timer for 8 minutes
        Sketch 8 different ideas (1 per box) for solving the problem
        Use basic shapes and text (low-fidelity wireframes)

Step 3: Create User Stories
        Define at least 3–5 personas (elderly, working professionals, students, doctors)
        For each, write user stories using:
        As a [user], I want to [goal], so that [benefit].
        Use sticky notes or frames in Figma to display each story

Step 4: Build Narrative Scenarios
        Pick a user story

        Describe:
        The user
        Their environment
        Their emotional state
        Tasks they’re trying to complete
        Represent using sticky notes, illustrations, or storyboards in Figma

Step 5: Create User Flow / Task Flow Diagram
        Choose a task (e.g., “Book appointment”)
        Use standard flowchart shapes:
               Start/End (Oval)
               Process/Action (Rectangle)
              Decision (Diamond)
              Connect the steps using arrows
              Design this using shapes and connectors in Figma

Step 6: Build Information Architecture (IA)
        Choose an app/site (e.g., Saveetha University)
        Perform open or closed card sorting
        Categorize and list out all sections (Home, Courses, Admissions, About Us, etc.)
        Create a site map using hierarchy boxes and lines in Figma
